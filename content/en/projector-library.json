  "description": "I am unable to find sufficient information to provide you with the official website, subscription price in USD, and cancellation guide for the service \"Projector Library\". My search yielded results related to projector lending services offered by various libraries. These libraries typically loan out projectors and screens to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nAs these are physical lending services, they do not involve monthly subscriptions or cancellation policies in the same way that a digital service would. Instead, they have loan periods, overdue fines, and replacement costs for lost or damaged equipment.\n\nIf you are referring to a different kind of \"Projector Library\" service, please provide more details so I can assist you further.",
